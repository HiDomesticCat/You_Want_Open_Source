### 在沒事做時，我特別喜歡瀏覽維基百科，因為時常可以觀看到神人對於某件人事物一針見血的見解，所以我們就以維基上對於[開源軟體的介紹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)，節錄我覺得重要的片段，來當此章節也是此文章的開始。

> Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.

### 簡單翻譯一下這段話（本人英文能力薄弱，有翻譯錯誤還請指教）

> 開源軟體是根據許可發布的軟體，其中版權持有者給予用戶**使用**、**學習**、**更改**和**像任何人以任何目的分發軟體及其源代碼的權力**。

> Scholars Casson and Ryan have pointed out several policy-based reasons for adoption of open source – in particular, the heightened value proposition from open source (when compared to most proprietary formats) in the following categories:
>   * Security
    * Affordability
    * Transparency
    * Perpetuity
    * Interoperability
    * Flexibility
    * Localization – particularly in the context of local governments (who make software decisions). Casson and Ryan argue that "governments have an inherent responsibility and fiduciary duty to taxpayers" which includes the careful analysis of these factors when deciding to purchase proprietary software or implement an open-source option.
